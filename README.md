# Machine Learning Practice Labs üöÄ

This repository contains a collection of hands-on machine learning exercises focusing on advanced topics such as neural networks, regularization, and decision trees. These notebooks demonstrate the implementation of key ML concepts from scratch.

## üìÇ Labs Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary Classification)
- **Task:** Train a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits as either "0" or "1".
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Building a feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras
  - Binary classification using sigmoid activation
  - Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Model evaluation using accuracy

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Handwritten Digit Recognition (Multiclass Classification)
- **Task:** Extend the previous model to classify digits from 0 to 9.
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Multiclass classification using softmax activation
  - Loss function: Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy
  - One-hot encoding of labels
  - Model performance evaluation using confusion matrix

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Preventing Overfitting with Regularization
